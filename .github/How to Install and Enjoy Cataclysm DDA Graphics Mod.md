# How to Install and Enjoy Cataclysm DDA Graphics Mod
 
Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead (CDDA) is a popular open-source roguelike game that features a post-apocalyptic world where you have to survive against zombies, mutants, robots, and other threats. The game has a lot of depth and complexity, but it also has a very simple ASCII graphics style that some players may find unappealing or hard to follow.

Fortunately, there is a way to enhance the game's visuals with a graphics mod that adds tiles, sprites, animations, and sound effects to the game. The graphics mod is compatible with the latest experimental versions of CDDA and can be easily installed and customized. In this article, we will show you how to install and enjoy Cataclysm DDA graphics mod in a few simple steps.
 
## Step 1: Download the Graphics Mod
 
The first step is to download the graphics mod from the official GitHub repository. You can find the latest release here: [https://github.com/SomeDeadGuy/UndeadPeopleTileset/releases](https://github.com/SomeDeadGuy/UndeadPeopleTileset/releases). The graphics mod is also known as UndeadPeopleTileset or UPT.
 
Choose the zip file that matches your operating system (Windows, Linux, or Mac) and download it to your computer. You don't need to unzip the file, just save it somewhere you can easily access later.
 
## Step 2: Copy the Graphics Mod to the Game Folder
 
The next step is to copy the graphics mod to the game folder where you have installed CDDA. You can find the game folder by right-clicking on the game's shortcut or executable file and choosing "Open file location". Alternatively, you can use the default installation paths for each operating system:
 
- Windows: C:\Program Files\Cataclysm DDA
- Linux: /home/username/.cataclysm-dda
- Mac: /Users/username/Library/Application Support/Cataclysm

Once you have located the game folder, open it and look for a subfolder called "gfx". This is where you need to copy the graphics mod. Simply drag and drop the zip file you downloaded earlier into the gfx folder. You don't need to unzip it or rename it.
 
## Step 3: Enable the Graphics Mod in the Game Options
 
The final step is to enable the graphics mod in the game options. Launch CDDA and go to the main menu. Choose "Options" and then "Graphics". You should see a list of available tilesets under the "Choose tileset" option. Scroll down until you find "UndeadPeopleTileset" and select it. You can also adjust other graphics settings such as window size, scaling factor, terminal width and height, etc.
 
After you have selected the graphics mod, press ESC to save your changes and return to the main menu. Choose "New Game" or "Load Game" and start playing with enhanced graphics. You should notice a significant difference in how the game looks and sounds. Enjoy!
  
## Step 4: Customize the Graphics Mod to Your Liking
 
One of the best features of the graphics mod is that it allows you to customize it to your liking. You can choose from different tilesets, sound packs, fonts, and color schemes to suit your preferences and playstyle. You can also mix and match different elements from different mods to create your own unique combination.
 
To customize the graphics mod, you need to edit the "config" file that is located in the gfx folder where you copied the zip file. You can open the file with any text editor such as Notepad or WordPad. The file contains various options and settings that you can change by editing the values or deleting the lines. For example, you can change the tileset by editing the line that says "tileset": "UndeadPeopleTileset" and replacing it with another tileset name. You can also change the sound pack by editing the line that says "soundpack": "Basic" and replacing it with another sound pack name.
 
You can find a list of available tilesets, sound packs, fonts, and color schemes in the README file that is included in the zip file. You can also check out the GitHub repository for more information and updates on the graphics mod. Be sure to save your changes after editing the config file and restart the game to apply them.
 
## Step 5: Enjoy Cataclysm DDA with Graphics Mod
 
That's it! You have successfully installed and customized Cataclysm DDA graphics mod. You can now enjoy the game with a new look and feel that enhances your immersion and gameplay experience. You can also explore new features and content that are added by the graphics mod, such as new monsters, items, vehicles, buildings, etc.
 
Cataclysm DDA graphics mod is a great way to spice up your game and make it more fun and accessible. It is also compatible with most mods and updates that are released for CDDA, so you don't have to worry about breaking your game or losing your progress. If you encounter any issues or bugs with the graphics mod, you can report them on the GitHub page or contact the developer directly.
